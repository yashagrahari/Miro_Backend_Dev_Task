Technical Document
Project Name: Speer BE Task(Notes App)


Technology Choices:

Django Rest Framework (DRF):

    Rationale:

        DRF is selected for its ability to efficiently build RESTful APIs with a consistent and modular structure.
        Its built-in features such as serialization, viewsets, and authentication classes streamline the development process, promoting rapid and maintainable code.
        Applicability to Task:

    Applicability to Task:

        DRF's integrated support for searching, throttling, and authentication aligns seamlessly with the requirements of creating, retrieving, sharing notes, and implementing throttling mechanisms.
        PostgreSQL:

PostgreSQL:
    Rationale:

        PostgreSQL is chosen for its reliability, ACID compliance, and advanced indexing capabilities.
        Its scalability and robust transaction support make it suitable for handling the storage and retrieval of notes in a highly concurrent environment.
    
    Applicability to Task:

        PostgreSQL's advanced indexing will optimize search queries, ensuring efficient retrieval of notes based on keywords.
        The database's ACID compliance provides a solid foundation for data integrity and reliability.
Redis:

    Rationale:

        Redis is employed for caching search results and implementing throttling.
        Its in-memory data structure store enhances performance by reducing the load on the database during repetitive searches and enabling efficient rate limiting.
    
    Applicability to Task:

        Redis, in conjunction with DRF's throttling system, provides a robust solution for preventing abuse and ensuring the scalability and responsiveness of the API.




Benefits and Considerations:
    Consistency and Maintainability:
        The combination of DRF's structure and PostgreSQL's reliability contributes to a consistent and maintainable codebase.
    Rapid Development:
        DRF's built-in features expedite development, allowing for the quick implementation of note management functionalities.
    Scalability:
        PostgreSQL's scalability and Redis's caching mechanisms provide a scalable foundation for handling increased user demand and data volume.
    Security:
        The use of DRF's authentication classes, secure storage in PostgreSQL, and efficient rate limiting with Redis ensures a secure and reliable API.
    Extensibility:
        The modular design of DRF and the extensibility of PostgreSQL and Redis allow for easy integration of additional features or enhancements in the future.
